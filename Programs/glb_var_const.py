Several archaeological finds from the Roman era have been found in the area: in addition to the votive altar already mentioned, located in the square in front of the church of San Giovanni Battista, four steles have been found, two of which with dedications, and a rectangular sarcophagus, hollowed out inside, missing the lid and with a lateral hole."

However, different theories have been developed about this name: In the ancient church of the current hamlet of San Pietro all'Olmo there was a fresco depicting Saint Peter with the net from which the Latin expression Sanctus Petrus cum rete which would have given rise to the two bordering villages of San Pietro and Cornaredo. The name Cornaredo specifically would be traced back to the term 'cum rete' which in the local dialect is translated as 'cun la ret' from which the modern Cornaredo. Derivation from Cornarjetum (Cornioleto) meaning land cultivated with dogwoods, that is, shrubs that grow especially in wooded clearings: from these shrubs a very hard wood is obtained, suitable for lathe work. Derivation from an ancient popular legend according to which in Cornaredo there was once a slaughterhouse that supplied meat to Milan: the cattle arrived alive in the town and were slaughtered and sent back to the Milanese, who checked the exact number of heads slaughtered by counting the horns of the animals that were returned.

In 2008 the municipality of Settimo Milanese won the 'Green City' award, due to the important works and investments in public greenery. From a toponymic point of view, it is believed that the name of the town derives from the distance from the city of Milan: it is in fact located near the seventh milestone of the road that connected Milan to Novara, later moved in the early Middle Ages.

text34 = "Melzo is an Italian municipality of 18,355 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. Melzo is approximately19 km from Milan, 35 from Bergamo and 10 from Linate airport. The alleged Etruscan origins, which according to tradition would connect Melzo to the ancient city of Melpum mentioned by Pliny the Elder-consequently represented in the cartography of Italia Gallica sive Gallia Cisalpina by Abraham Ortelius at the site of the current city-have never been proven, nor is there an archaeological find capable of confirming this location. The analogy between the two toponyms is not etymologically sustainable, just as it is not possible to hypothesize a certain historical continuity, in the face of two cities of which Melpum was destroyed, according to tradition, at the beginning of the 4th century BC, while the most ancient mentions of Melzo are not attested before the 12th century AD. Furthermore, the position of the Etruscan city is also debated: some authors even place it south of the Po, along the trans-Apennine trade routes, since the location, like the current town, near the flourishing Mediolanum, is not compatible with its vaunted wealth(opulentia praecipum)."

The municipality of Bareggio has three hamlets, the most distant of which is Brughiera, a small town that has been expanding in recent decades and is located towards the border with Pregnana Milanese. San Martino di Bareggio, on the other hand, although it qualifies better as a locality due to the expansion of the main town, is still widely recognized by the population as a hamlet at a territorial and cultural level, as demonstrated by the feast of San Martino, in which flags with the colors that historically identified the hamlet are displayed in the territory of San Martino."
text38 = "Nerviano is an Italian municipality of 16,982 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. Located about 12 kilometers (as the crow flies) northwest of the Lombard capital along the ancient Roman road that connected Milan with Verbano, the Via Severiana Augusta (the modern Strada statale 33 del Sempione ), Nerviano is located in an area bathed by the Olona river, the Bozzente stream and crossed by the Villoresi canal. The presence of the three waterways, once very useful for cultivation, today creates several problems especially in light of the intense humanization of the area. In Roman times, the Via Severiana Augusta passed through Nerviano, a Roman consular road that connected Mediolanum (modern Milan) with Verbannus Lacus (Lake Verbano, or Lake Maggiore), and from here to the Simplon Pass ( lat. Summo Plano )."

Located instead on the border with the municipality of Cernusco sul Naviglio and parallel to the Naviglio Martesana is the Cava Gaggiolo, now covered with water for which a redevelopment process has been started that will lead it to become a park. In Roman times the territory of Vimodrone was crossed by an important Roman road, the Via Gallica. Held, in the second half of the 12th century, by Pope Alexander III under the authority of the chapter of the church of San Giovanni Battista in Monza, at the end of the 14th century it returned, in part, to the possessions of the Pozzobonelli family, passing in the 17th century to those of the Modroni. In 1690 Vimodrone was enfeoffed to Nicola Maria Visconti who, appointed marquis, added the feudal predicate of Modrone, thus giving rise to the lineage of Visconti di Modrone, to which illustrious figures belonged; among these, it is worth remembering, in the 18th century, Count Nicola, professor of public law in Milan, and, in the 19th century, Duke Uberto who, together with his sons, actively participated in the Risorgimento uprisings."
text40 = "Pieve Emanuele is an Italian municipality of 15,776 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. The municipal territory is crossed by the southern Lambro drain, whose erosive action has created the Valle delle Volpi, and is lapped by the Olona river.

It was located in the historical territory of Vimercatese, from which however it separated, being the only one not to have joined the new province of Monza and Brianza in 2004. The etymology of the name is unclear. Some of the many ideas proposed are: carrucata, 'area of ​​land that a farmer can cultivate with a pair of oxen'; carrivium, 'road for carts'; callugate, 'hazy lands'; el caraga, 'insect parasite of the vine'; and carugol, 'tool for threshing grain'. The historical events of Carugate are common to those of this entire area of ​​Lombardy, once populated by the Orobi peoples, the Ligurians, the Celts and the Etruscans, later supplanted by the Romans. Then came the Lombards converted to Christianity and the invasions of Barbarossa."

On 25 August 1946 Benito Mussolini's corpse was hidden in the town, remaining here until 30 August 1957. The origin of the name derives from Latin cerrus which means cerro, a deciduous tree of the oak family.

The Guisa and Nirone streams flow through the municipal area and, joining at Baranzate, give rise to the Merlata stream (a tributary of the Olona ). The ancient name of the town was Cixate as it appears in the manuscript Liber Notitiae Sanctorum Mediolani by Goffredo da Bussero. Although several hypotheses have been formulated, the etymology of the name is still not certain. The toponym began to be Italianized in Cisate and then evolved into Cesate."
text44 = "Solaro is an Italian comune of 14,120 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy, and is located 19 km kilometers north of the city center of Milan. The royal decree of 4 November 1809 decreed the suppression of the Municipality of Solaro, annexed to that of Ceriano. However, in the Lombardy-Veneto Kingdom the Austrians promptly restored the municipal autonomy of Solaro. When Solaro became part of the Kingdom of Italy, the Royal Decree of 9 February 1869 restored, as in several other cases, the provisions of that of 1809, and Solaro was once again deprived of its autonomy to be annexed to the Municipality of Ceriano Laghetto. The separatist pressures remained strong, however, and resulted on 20 July 1919 in the decree that definitively re-established the Municipality of Solaro. "

Despite being in a highly urbanized area, the town maintains intact important traces of its agricultural and natural history. Crossed by the Canale Villoresi which has profoundly changed its natural geography, Busto Garolfo is in fact characterized by the presence of a strong woodland and rural component. The wooded areas to the south and east of the municipal territory are part of the Roccolo Park.

text47 = "Opera is an Italian municipality of 14,389 inhabitants of the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. The oldest historical source attesting to the existence of a place called Opera dates back to 1280 and is due to Goffredo da Bussero. The latter, a priest of noble family, in his “Liber Notitiae Sanctorum Mediolani” recalls “in plebe Locate, in Mirasolum, ecclesia S. Mariae […] in plebe Locate… Loco Ovari, ecclesia S. Petri”. The same Latin toponym of “Overa” is found in the name of the nearby hamlet of Noverasco, removing the suffix “sco” usually characterizing names of pre-Roman origin (such as bergama–sco, crema–sco, etc.) and removing a prepositive “in” at the beginning of the expression “IN–OVERA–SCO”. Since the Early Middle Ages (for example in the capitularies of Charlemagne ) the word Opera had the legal meaning of Fabbriceria or Fabbrica : therefore the expression “Overa S. Petri” used by Goffredo da Bussero could allude to the “fabbriceria of a possible monastery of San Pietro ” (so Dante Olivieri in Dizionario di Toponomastica Lombarda, Milan, 1961 ), of which however there is a lack of documents."

The same topic in detail: Geography of Lombardy and Legnanese (territory). Canegrate is located in the Legnano area, along the course of the Olona river, south of the Varese Prealps. The soil is mainly composed of pebbles, gravel, sand and clay. It was once covered by a thin layer of humus which was not very suitable for the growth of woods and subsequently for agricultural cultivation, so much so that it was largely groana. Due to the presence of clayey layers sedimented in correspondence with the ancient beds of the Olona, ​​the soil struggles to absorb rainwater."
text50 = "Trezzo sull'Adda and simply Trezzo until 1862, is an Italian municipality of 12,243 inhabitants located east of the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. Although it belongs to the Archdiocese of Milan, Trezzo has not preserved the Ambrosian rite, except for a peculiar Carnival event, 'Il povero Piero'. Near Concesa, a hamlet of Trezzo, the water of the Adda gives life to the Martesana Canal. The origin of the name is unknown, although there are several theories about it. The name is probably due to the strategic position occupied by the ancient nucleus of the municipality, on a rocky spur that forces the Adda river to form a bend. The discovery of finds from the Lombard era, located on the plateau west of the city, has consolidated this hypothesis."

Situated at 156 metres above sea level, Arluno has a typical setting of the upper Po Valley. It is19.5 km from Milan Cathedral and 12.5 from the Ticino River. In the Corografia dell'Italia (1832), Giovanni B. Rampoldi, traces the name back to the Aruleni, a hypothetical ancient and powerful Insubrian family, where here the term would stand for Western Lombards or at most Gallo-Romans, who owned a villa with orchards; Dante Olivieri in his Dictionary of Lombard Toponymy (1931) declares that names with the ending 'uno' can be assumed to be of Gallic origin, or Celtic if derived from people or things. The claim that the name Arluno derives from the Latin Ara Lunae ('Altar of the Moon'), is to be attributed to Filippo Argelati who in his work entitled Bibliotheca Scriptorum mediolanensium published in 1745, under the entry Bernardinus Arlunus latinizes the term Arluno in Ara Lunae, and it is the first time ever that this term is used."

It was converted to a military fortress by the Counts of Biandrate, passing eventually to the House of Visconti. During internal struggles within the House of Visconti, Castano was pillaged. The fortress was rebuilt in the 14th century and ownership passed to the Archbishop. Various periods of struggle and domination by the Visconti followed until, in 1447, Castano came under the control of the House of Sforza who gave it as fiefdom to a family favourite. In the 16th century the war between the French and Spanish waged around the town but remained it under the control of the Viscount of Brignano until 1717. By 1604 the population of Castano was around 1500 people."
text56 = "Pero is an Italian municipality of 11,840 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan, in Lombardy, located between the capital and Rho ; located along the Sempione state road, it is crossed by the Olona river. The name Pero should derive from the medieval toponym Cassina del Pero: in fact, already in the 10th century, a farmstead was known on the site whose main production was probably fruit and in particular pears. Another hypothesis derives the name from the geographical position: in ancient times, in fact, it was the first place that one encountered from Milan along the Mediolanum-Verbannus road, already existing in pre-Roman times, therefore Pero would derive from an expression of the Raeti which had the meaning of the road. In 1894, the Municipality of Cassina del Pero changed its name simply to Pero, with a resolution of the Municipal Council dated 29 April and accepted by King Umberto I on 23 December of the same year."

Settala is included, albeit with some discrepancy, in the geographical area of ​​Martesana, which has undefined limits. The territory of Settala, although belonging to the Po Valley, is characterised by an imperceptible slope which makes the eastern part of the same lower in altitude; this characteristic meant that in the Middle Ages this part was lapped by the waters, or rather by the external marshes of the no longer existing Lake Gerundo, in the period of maximum expansion."
text60 = "Vignate is an Italian municipality of 9,373 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy, today markedly industrial but historically of agricultural vocation. It is part of the Martesana territory. The name Vignate most likely derives from the toponym 'Vineate', from the Latin term vinea (' vineyard ') and the Celtic suffix –aite ('place', 'district'). The municipality has Roman origins, just look at the street layout of the historic center, and it owes its name to the typical cultivation of vines, once abundant in the municipal territory before the arrival of phylloxera. Vignate appears for the first time in a notarial deed dated 25 May 776. Upon the death of the last feudal lord, Count Antonio Teodoro Trivulzio, on 26 July 1678, the Vignanese Community paid the Spanish government 48 lire for each family for a total of 4,074 lire, thus obtaining two days later from the Spanish government of Milan the redemption from feudal constraints, unlike most of the other neighbouring lands which were then enfeoffed again."

Ancient Celtic settlements show the origin of the municipality, as in the toponym Vantac there are both the root -an- and the ending -ac, later changed into the Latin Ventiacum. The first documentary evidence of the name dates back to 864, transcribed in the Codex Diplomaticus Langobardorum. Under the reign of Napoleon, Vanzago was annexed to Pogliano. For centuries Vanzago lived on a predominantly agricultural economy, as demonstrated by the presence of some old farmhouses, formerly located in the many green areas of today. In the first half of the twentieth century, important factories were born such as the Cotonificio Valle Ticino, a large weaving mill that, in the 1930s, employed over 350 male and female workers, closing in 1955, and the Cuoital company that produced footwear. There were also other companies and shops, including the Officina meccanica di Ulisse Cantoni, the Fratelli Carini salami factory and others, all now closed.

text64 = "Pessano con Bornago is an Italian municipality of 9,021 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy. The municipality has an area of ​​6.66 square kilometers and is part of the Martesana territory. The name 'Pessano' is most likely of Gallo-Roman origin, perhaps from a landowner named Pettius or Pettianus. The Latin ending -anum denotes landed property, and is typical of towns of Roman origin. The toponym 'Bornago' seems to be more ancient, and may instead derive from an Insubrian village chief named Bornos (='the furious), with the addition of the typically Celtic ending-akon, indicating an inhabited place or more probably from the Celtic root bor- meaning 'source' in reference to the fountains. The stream that flows through the town, called Molgora, derives from the Celtic murg which means 'border river'. The locality Valera, which includes a farmhouse, is located west of the stream between the municipalities of Pessano con Bornago and Carugate. It seems that its name derives from the Latin vallis and it is likely that it indicated the construction of the small village in a flat area beyond the Molgora."

The municipality is located halfway between Bergamo and Milan and is situated on the border between the two provinces, marked by the Adda river, on the Milanese side. Traces of its foundation have been lost. Some scholars believe that Vaprio d'Adda was originally founded as a castrum around the year 300 with the erection of the first bridge over the Adda River called 'Pons Aureoli', from the Roman general who had it built. In Roman times, the territory of Vaprio d'Adda was crossed by an important Roman road, the Via Gallica. We have to go back to 990 to find Vapris in a document. The toponym, however, could be of Celtic or Latin origin, linking the name to vadulum, meaning 'small ford'."
text68 = "Lacchiarella is an Italian municipality of 9,140 inhabitants in the metropolitan city of Milan in Lombardy, located south of the regional capital. The name Lacchiarella, in Lombard Laciarèla, means 'small dairy' and this definition must be attributed to the milk production of the area. The municipality of Lacchiarella is located south of Milan in the lower area of ​​the Po Valley. From Cascina Decima, the modern Lombard court of Lacchiarella, passed the Roman road that connected Mediolanum with Ticinum ( Pavia ). Its name derives from Ad Decimum, which recalls its distance in miles from Mediolanum."
